### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Dieghor88/Dieghor88** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects that I need for my life and as an English/Chinese Teacher.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a front-end project that could help me learn and hopefully find a job as a programmer one day. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any of the programming languages I am learning. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about teaching English and Chinese as a second language.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: carvallho88@gmail.com 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started learning programming because I was interested in how AIs work, but I honestly love learning about front-end programming.
